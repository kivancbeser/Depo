Basic Hazard Game Rules

Hazard Dice

Hazard is an Old English game played with two dice. Rules for Hazard are as follows:

Any number of players may participate, but only one player, called the caster, 
has the dice at any one time. In each round, the caster specifies a number between 5 and 9 inclusive: 
this is the main. The caster then throws two dice.

•	If he rolls the main (sum of the two dice), he wins (throws in or nicks).

•	If he rolls a 2 or a 3, he loses (throws out).

•	If he rolls an 11 or 12, the result depends on the main:

o 	with a main of 5 or 9, he throws out with both an 11 and a 12;

o 	with a main of 6 or 8, he throws out with an 11 but nicks with a 12;

o 	with a main of 7, he nicks with an 11 but throws out with a 12.

•	If he neither nicks nor throws out, the number thrown is called the chance. He throws the dice again:

o 	if he rolls the chance, he wins;

o 	if he rolls the main, he loses (unlike on the first throw);

o 	if he rolls neither, he keeps throwing until he rolls one or the other, winning with the chance and losing with the main.


As  long  as  he  keeps  winning,  the  caster  may  keep  playing:  but  if  he  loses  three  times  in succession, 
he must pass the dice to the player to his left, who becomes the new caster.
